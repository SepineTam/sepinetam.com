## About

I am an undergraduate student at **Shanghai University**, majoring in Economics. My research focuses on Labor Economics, Development Economics, and AI applications in economic research.

I am the founder of **Stata-MCP**, an open-source tool that enables LLMs to write and execute Stata code automatically. I also serve as CEO at **Shanghai Bayes Views Info-tech Co., Ltd.**, working on AI-powered accessibility solutions.

Beyond research, I create content about economics through my podcast *"Lunjin: Economics in Depth"*.

## Research Interests

- Labor Economics (gender equality, labor markets, employment in China)
- Development Economics (rural development, cooperatives, sustainable growth)
- Economic History (long-term development patterns, institutional change)
- AI in Economics (automated empirical analysis, LLM-assisted research)
